We can create multiple authentication filters, and multiple authentication providers. Make sure that each authentication filter corresponds to one authentication provider.
For example, we can create a username-password, email-password, and OAuth google authentication provider, we must also create a authentication filter that supports it. So that it can create the proper authentication object

When creating a project in scratch, I would first think about the security side first. I would look at how the Authentication Logic and implement it depending on the applications' needs.
Think about the strategy that you will use in the security context. Each strategy vary depending on your case.
    Strategies:
        * MODE_THREADLOCAL
        * MODE_INHERITEDTHREADLOCAL
        * MODE_GLOBAL

    Didn't really learn or dove deep in the threads or strategies, since I figured that I won't really need to customize it. Might learn it later if needed for my project.

    AuthenticationEntryPoint()
        I was introduced to Entry Points, it’s the component that handles what happens when a user tries to access a protected resource without being authenticated.
        We can use entry point on these two methods in the SecurityConfig() method, either on the http.httpBasic() or http.exceptionHandling().

            Use entry point on http.httpBasic() when:
                “Whenever HTTP Basic authentication is used and fails or is missing credentials, use this entry point.”

            Use entry point on http.exceptionHandling() when:
                “Whenever an unauthenticated request tries to access a protected resource — regardless of mechanism — use this entry point globally.”

        The best approach is to use both if possible.


    Authentication Handler

        AuthenticationSuccessHandler()

        AuthenticationFailureHandler()


    The difference between EntryPoint and AuthenticationHandler:
        "In Spring Security, an **AuthenticationEntryPoint** and an **AuthenticationHandler** serve different roles in the authentication flow. The **AuthenticationEntryPoint** is triggered when a user tries to access a protected resource **without being authenticated**, meaning no credentials were provided at all. It decides how the system should respond—such as returning a `401 Unauthorized` for APIs or redirecting to a login page for web apps. On the other hand, an **AuthenticationHandler** (specifically the `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` and `AuthenticationFailureHandler`) is used **after a login attempt** has been made. The success handler runs when authentication succeeds (e.g., logging in successfully), while the failure handler runs when authentication fails (e.g., wrong username or password).
        In short, the entry point handles *unauthenticated access*, while the handlers deal with *the result of an authentication attempt*."
