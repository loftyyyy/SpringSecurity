We can create multiple authentication filters, and multiple authentication providers. Make sure that each authentication filter corresponds to one authentication provider.
For example, we can create a username-password, email-password, and OAuth google authentication provider, we must also create a authentication filter that supports it. So that it can create the proper authentication object

When creating a project in scratch, I would first think about the security side first. I would look at how the Authentication Logic and implement it depending on the applications' needs.
Think about the strategy that you will use in the security context. Each strategy vary depending on your case.
    Strategies:
        * MODE_THREADLOCAL
        * MODE_INHERITEDTHREADLOCAL
        * MODE_GLOBAL.
